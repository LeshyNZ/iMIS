//Task to backup data at point in time for reporting

//Step 1
//Set up query for data to be recorded
//I have used Status, ID(Count) and added a date column for the current date as date recorded

//IQA
SELECT TOP 10000 Count([vBoNetContactData].[ID]) AS [ID], 
    [vBoNetContactData].[Status], 
    CONVERT(char(10), 
    DATEADD(HH,
    +12,
    GetDate()),
    126)	 AS [Date Recorded]
  FROM  vBoNetContactData
  WHERE [vBoNetContactData].[MemberType] = 'SW'
  GROUP BY [vBoNetContactData].[Status]

//Step 2
//Create a panel for the Backups
//Mine is called SWRB_Backups
//Contains Status, Count and Backup_Date

//Step 3
//Using CSI tools, iUpdate, map the IQA wwith the panel data
Panel Data (SWRB_Backup).Backup_Date = Date Recorded
Panel Data (SWRB_Backup).Count = ID
Panel Data (SWRB_Backup).Status = Status

//Step 4
//Set this as a monthly scheduled task in CSI

//Step 5
//Build a dashboard using the backup panel data
